## 📌 Objective

To build a binary classification model using **XGBoost** that can accurately distinguish between patients with and without cancer based on gene expression levels.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: ~92%
- **Precision**: ~91.8%
- **Recall**: ~90.8%
- **F1-score**: ~91.3%
- **Confusion Matrix**:
    - True Positives: 247
    - True Negatives: 306
    - False Positives: 22
    - False Negatives: 25

The results show that the model performs **consistently well** across both classes.

---

## ✅ Summary

This project demonstrates the power of **XGBoost** in handling structured biomedical datasets. With only two gene features, the model achieved high accuracy and generalizability.

---

## 🔭 Future Work

- Introduce more gene features (multi-gene classification)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Try alternative classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes)
- Deploy model via a web app for user interaction
